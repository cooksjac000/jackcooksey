									Combat Robotics Project</h1>
									<p>In Spring 2025, I led my combat robotics team, the Mechaniacs, in building a 3lb combat robot to compete in the Texas Robo Rumble. TRR was a tournament-style competition hosted by UT, where 15 teams competed with a $300 budget each. Over a 7-week build phase, I led all aspects of creating the robot, from brainstorming to final iterations. Our robot, Comparator, placed 5th overall in the competition, 1st among teams with no 3lb experience.</p>

										<div class="col-6">
											<h2>Design Process</h2>
											<p>First, I led my team in researching and brainstorming ideas. We decided to base our design on the former 3lb world champion, Lynx, and a low-cost robot of the same style, the Peter Bar, because we had no experience with 3lb robots, and we wanted to iterate on a proven design. Our main iteration was replacing the old drive system with a tangent drive. This used a tangent drive motor, which had a much higher output RPM at 26000 compared to a standard direct drive with 2300. This increased our drivetrain speed but decreased its torque. I decided this was a worthy trade because our main focus would be on hitting the opponent instead of pushing them.</p>

										<div class="col-6">
											<h2>Design Process</h2>
											<p>For the CAD, I decided to use the Onshape platform because it has by far the best collaboration system of any CAD platform, and it can be run on all of my team's computers. I delegated CAD responsibilities across my team, and I was responsible for designing the top and bottom plates of our robot.</p>

										</div>
										<div class="col-6">
											<h2>Design Process</h2>
											<p>Then we moved to rapid prototyping and produced an MVP using 3D-printed PLA parts to prove that our drivetrain and weapon system would function; preliminary tests confirmed that everything worked well. During this phase, I sourced parts from reputable suppliers while making sure to keep under the $300 budget, along with 3D printing, assembling, and driving the test chassis.</p>

									<!-- Design Process Paragraph 4: Text Left, Image Right -->
									<div class="row gtr-50" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
										<div class="col-6">
											<h2>Design Process</h2>
											<p>Next, we started the next phase of prototyping with 3D-printed TPU parts, but we encountered a major issue: our tangent motors destroyed our polyurethane wheels when we ran our Four Wheel Drive configuration. I spent the majority of my iteration time fixing this issue, and eventually, designed a motor output shaft that fixed this by spreading the load evenly across the wheel.</p>

											<h2>Design Process</h2>
											<p>Finally, I machined our frame rails out of UHMW and our top and bottom plates out of aluminum using a CNC router. I also ordered AR500 weapons from SendCutSend because I didn't have access to a machine that could mill or laser cut that material. With these parts, we assembled our final robot and were able to have some drive practice before the day of the competition, a rare thing in the combat robotics space.</p>

									<!-- Materials Selection Section: Text Left, Image Right -->

										<div class="col-6">
											<h2>Materials Selection</h2>
											<p>Coming into the competition, I wanted to select the best materials for each part of Comparator. For our outside armor, I prioritized its capacity for elastic deformation, because it would take repeated hits. The best material for this application was TPU, with a very high elastic limit. For the frame rails, which are responsible for keeping the whole robot in place, I needed a material with high stiffness that was light enough to fit within the 3lb limit and wouldn't break the bank, so I decided to use UHMW. For the top and bottom plates, I was concerned that there might be a hammersaw-style robot at this competition, which is a robot that attacks an opponent by hitting down on their top or bottom if they're flipped over. So, I needed a material that would withstand puncturing, but wouldn't be too heavy. I chose aluminum 7075 for this application. Finally, for the weapon, I intended to spin at very high speeds to hit an enemy with as much energy as possible. I also wanted to win weapon-on-weapon engagements. So, my weapon needed to be tougher than the opponent's so that it wouldn't shatter on impact. With these considerations in mind, I chose AR500 steel for my weapon.</p>

										</div>
										<div class="col-6">
											<h2>Major Challenge: Wheel Chewing</h2>
											<p>Our biggest issue was that our tangent drive motors would chew up our wheels within around 30 seconds of a match starting, meaning we would lose our ability to control the drivetrain in the middle of a match. The way tangent motors work is that they run parallel to the wheel and use friction to transfer torque to the wheel. And, our tangent motors came with a shaft that only covered half the length of the wheel, meaning there was a large mismatch between the forces on the wheel where it was being contacted and where it wasn't. When we switched to Four Wheel Drive, we created high pressure between the shaft and the wheel, making this issue even worse. Diagnosing this issue took most of my iteration time, because I tried everything from loosening the Four Wheel Drive belt to changing the wheel attachment geometry. Eventually, I made a custom output shaft and retrofitted the motor so that the force on the wheel would be constant across its length. This fixed our issue, letting us drive for however long we needed to in a match.</p>

										<div class="col-6">
											<h2>Results</h2>
											<p>I led my team in placing 5th overall and 1st out of teams with no prior 3lb experience, with a record of 2 wins and 2 losses. But our decision to use a tangent drive would be our downfall. In our last match, we were doing very well against our opponent, but then Comparator got stuck in a gap in the wall and couldn't drive back out because of our low torque. This led to us being knocked out, giving our opponent the win.</p>

										<div class="col-6">
											<h2>Future Considerations</h2>
											<p>To improve our design, we could swap our friction-based drive to one that uses a geared output shaft on the tangent motors. This would improve our torque while still keeping some of the speed increase from the tangent motors. This compromise would increase our overall performance.</p>
